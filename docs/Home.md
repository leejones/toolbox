This wiki is like my outboard brain. It contains documentation for things like:

* **keyboard shortcuts** that I commonly use (or am trying to learn) (e.g. how to move items around in Omnifocus)
* **command line flags** I sometimes need, but can't always remember (e.g. how to convert a video to an animated gif with ffmpeg)
* **concepts** that I frequently reference and/or am trying to internalize (e.g. the flow for how Varnish processes a request)
