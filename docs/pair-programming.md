# Pair Programming

## ðŸ“º Empathetic Pair Programming with Nonviolent Communication

A [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-ukCrsrTNw) by Stephanie Minn at RubyConf Mini 2022.

- Nonviolent Communication (NVC) Framework
  - 2 parts:
    - 1. Expressing honestly without criticising yourself (empathizing with yourself)
    - 2. Listening empathetically without hearing blame or criticism (empathetic listening)
  - Talk focuses mostly on part 1.
  - Each part has 4 components
    - Observations
      - Avoid judgements, assumptions, and generalizations. Instead, focus on what you can see/hear.
    - Feelings
      - Sometimes we describe things as feelings that really aren't. For example "I feel unsupported by the team" is less of a feeling and more of an assessment/judement about the teams behavior.
      - "External factors can be a stimulus for our feeling, but we are responsible for them." Similar to it's not about what happens, but our opinion(s) of what happened.
    - Needs
      - Physicological safety is a core need in pair programming.
      - Communicate what you need and ask/listen for what others need.
    - Requests
      - Be clear. Avoid vague and ambiguous language.
      - Try to describe what you would like instead of what you would not like. Focusing on the negative might be confusing or more likely misunderstood.
      - Requests != demands. It's ok for people to say no. Try to emphasize with them.
