## ðŸ“º Empathetic Pair Programming with Nonviolent Communication

A [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-ukCrsrTNw) by Stephanie Minn at RubyConf Mini 2022.

- Nonviolent Communication (NVC) Framework
  - 2 parts:
    - 1. Expressing honestly without criticising yourself (empathizing with yourself)
    - 2. Listening empathetically without hearing blame or criticism (empathetic listening)
  - Talk focuses mostly on part 1.
  - Each part has 4 components
    - Observations
    - Feelings
    - Needs
    - Requests

| Component | Clear and Honest Expression | Empathetic Listening |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Observation | When I see/hear...| When you see/here... |
| Feeling | I feel... | Are you feeling... |
| Need | Because I need/value | Because you need/value |
| Request | Would you be willing...? | Would you like...? |
