## Keeping the right people informed/involved

Etsy's blog post on [Selecting a Cloud Provider](https://codeascraft.com/2018/01/04/selecting-a-cloud-provider/) mentions using the RACI model for keeping the relevant people involved and/or informed. RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed. Here's how they defined the terms:

> * **Responsible** – This is the person ultimately responsible for completing the project or initiative.
> * **Accountable** – This is the person to whom the R is accountable, and who must approve the work before it is okay to complete.
> * **Consulted** – These people might have data that is useful in completing the project.
> * **Informed** – These are people that should be kept informed or notified about the progress of the project but who do not need to approve of any step or artifact.
