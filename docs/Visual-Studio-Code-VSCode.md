## Jumping back/forth between definitions and references etc

When ctl clicking on a method to go to its definition or references, VSCode builds a stack of locations visited (like a browser history). Navigate foward/back through the stack with the following keyboard shortcuts:

Go back: `ctl + -` (hyphen)
Go forward: `ctl + _` (underscore)

## Editing Multiple Lines/Locations at Once

To edit multiple lines/locations at once:

1. `option + click` each place in the document you want to edit
1. make the edit(s)
1. press `esc` to end this mode
