# Demo Every Day

This is one of the themes from reading Mitchell Hashimoto's [blog post](https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-large-technical-projects) titled "My Approach to Building Large Technical Projects".

Even though you might not actually demo it literally every day, work towards a state of being able to demo the work. This helps to focus the effort towards providing value and also provides periodic boosts in motivation because you see something real. Sustaining motiviation and delivering incremental value are especially valuable on large projects. This surfaces issues sooner. It's ok if it's a prototype that will be thrown away. Focus on something real that can be demo'd. This has a positive effect on planning and scoping.
