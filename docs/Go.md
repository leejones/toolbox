## Go Modules

### Use a local copy of a module

This is useful for local development when working on two modules in parallel (e.g. a client library and an app that uses it).

```
# Run go mod edit first, even if the module is not in go.mod yet
go mod edit -replace=github.com/USERNAME/REPO=/PATH/TO/LOCAL/REPO
# Get the module using its normal url
go get github.com/USERNAME/REPO
```

### Use a forked version of a module

This is useful when you want to use a fork of a module (e.g. a branch where the PR has not been merged upstream yet):

```
# @BRANCH_NAME is optional
go mod edit -replace=github.com/UPSTREAM_USERNAME/REPO=github.com/FORK_USERNAME/REPO@BRANCH_NAME
go get github.com/UPSTREAM_USERNAME/REPO
```

Use `github.com/UPSTREAM_USERNAME/REPO` in the `import` statements also (not the URL of the fork).
